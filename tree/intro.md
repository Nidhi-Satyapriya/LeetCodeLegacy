Full Binary Tree: In this type, every node strictly adheres to having either zero children (making it a leaf) or exactly two children.   

Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree is considered complete if all its levels are fully filled, with the possible exception of the last level. If the last level is not entirely full, its nodes must be filled from left to right. This property is critical for efficient array-based representation.   

Perfect Binary Tree: This is a binary tree where all leaf nodes are located at the same level, and every non-leaf node has precisely two children. Such trees are perfectly balanced.   

Degenerate (or Pathological) Tree: This extreme case occurs when each parent node has only one child, effectively transforming the tree into a linear structure resembling a linked list.
